# Vercel "No Output Directory named 'public' found" Fix

## Issue

Vercel was looking for a `public` directory because it was auto-detecting this as a frontend project instead of a Node.js API.

## Solution

1. **Created `vercel.json`** - Explicitly configured this as a Node.js serverless function
2. **Created `api/index.js`** - Vercel serverless function entry point that imports the compiled Express app
3. **Modified `src/index.ts`** - Added `export default app` for Vercel compatibility
4. **Created `.vercelignore`** - Optimized deployment by excluding unnecessary files

## How it works

- Vercel builds the TypeScript to `dist/` directory
- `api/index.js` imports the compiled Express app from `dist/index.js`
- Vercel treats `api/index.js` as a serverless function
- All routes are handled by the Express app

## File Structure

```
api/
  index.js          # Vercel serverless function entry point
dist/               # Compiled TypeScript (generated by npm run build)
  index.js          # Compiled Express app
src/                # TypeScript source
  index.ts          # Main Express app (exports app for Vercel)
vercel.json         # Vercel configuration
.vercelignore       # Files to exclude from deployment
```

## Deployment Process

1. Vercel runs `npm run build` (builds TypeScript to `dist/`)
2. Vercel creates serverless function from `api/index.js`
3. `api/index.js` imports the Express app from `dist/index.js`
4. All HTTP requests are routed to the Express app

This eliminates the "public directory not found" error by explicitly configuring Vercel for Node.js API deployment.
