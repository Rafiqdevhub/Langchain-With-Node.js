# Deployment Fixes Applied

## Issue: TypeScript showing help instead of compiling

### Root Cause:

The TypeScript compiler was showing help output instead of compiling, indicating issues with tsconfig.json configuration.

### Fixes Applied:

1. **Updated tsconfig.json** with more explicit configuration:

   - Changed target to `es2020` (lowercase)
   - Added `noEmitOnError: true` to fail build on errors
   - Added `isolatedModules: true` for better compatibility
   - Specified exact include pattern: `src/**/*.ts`

2. **Created vercel.json** for proper Vercel deployment:

   - Configured `@vercel/node` builder
   - Set up proper routing for API endpoints
   - Added health check endpoint route

3. **Enhanced package.json** build scripts:

   - Updated build command to use explicit project reference
   - Added clean and vercel-build scripts

4. **Added health endpoint** at `/health` for monitoring

5. **Created .vercelignore** to exclude unnecessary files

### Verification:

- ✅ TypeScript compiles successfully locally
- ✅ Server starts and runs without errors
- ✅ Health endpoint responds correctly
- ✅ All source files compile to dist/ directory

### Deployment Command:

The build should now work with:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Expected Vercel Build Process:

1. Install dependencies
2. Run `npm run build` (which runs `tsc --project tsconfig.json`)
3. Create dist/ directory with compiled JS files
4. Deploy dist/index.js as the main entry point

If you still see the TypeScript help output, it likely means there's a caching issue or the updated files haven't been committed to your git repository.
